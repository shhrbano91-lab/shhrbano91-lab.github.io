    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, Iâ€™m Sheher Bano â€” a Project and Programme Manager with more than five years of experience 
      managing complex projects across the software and development sectors. In addition to my role 
      as Project and Programme Manager, I worked as a Coordinator in Eucation sector, where I managed 
      day-to-day operational tasks, facilitated communication across teams, and ensured projects ran 
      smoothly. This role allowed me to develop strong organizational skills and gain hands-on experience
      in coordinating multiple initiatives simultaneously.    
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work as a Software Programme Manager, leading cross-functional teams and 
      delivering large-scale technology solutions. Before transitioning into the tech sector, 
      I managed impactful education and development projects, which gave me a strong foundation 
      in stakeholder engagement, problem-solving, and delivering meaningful and sustainable outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Academically, I hold a postgraduate degree in Project Management as well as a postgraduate 
      degree in Education and International Development. I also earned my undergraduate degree 
      in Economics. Alongside my work, I continue to upskill â€” most 
      recently gaining PMI certification in Agile Project Leadership.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey has been shaped by resilience, adaptability, and a passion for using project 
      management as a tool for driving positive change. Whether in technology or community-focused 
      initiatives, I thrive on bringing structure to complexity and helping teams succeed.
